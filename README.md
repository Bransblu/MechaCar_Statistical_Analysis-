## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

- **Vehicle length** and **ground clearance** (as well as the intercept value) provide the most significant non-random amount of variance to Miles Per Gallon (mpg). The p-value for vehicle_length is 2.60e-12 and the p-value for ground_clearance is 5.21e-08. The slope is not equal to zero as the p-value is 5.35e-11. The linear model is sufficient with an r-squared value of .7149, or a 71% accuracy rate.
